# JavaScript Calculator  

A simple, responsive calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project is part of my learning journey and portfolio — created to practice DOM manipulation, CSS grid layouts, and handling user input both via mouse and keyboard (including **numpad support**).
